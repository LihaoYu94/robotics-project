A 6DOF UR3 robot simulation using V-REP

We use V-REP as the simulation envrionment. You can download and install V-REP from this link here: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html

In order to run the code, you need to open up V-REP and import the UR3 robot into the scence. Attach the code in the ZIP folder to the robot and run the simulation by clicking on the RUN button in V-REP. After this, you should be able to see the robot arm moving as shown in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu9Fpxxuqec
